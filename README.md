# HandyHub
 HandyHub is a community-driven app designed to simplify tool lending and borrowing within residential neighborhoods. Inspired by the initiative of the Stickan community association, HandyHub provides a user-friendly platform for residents to easily exchange tools for their renovation and construction projects.  With HandyHub, users can effortlessly browse a catalog of available tools, spanning from impact drills to tiger saws, and seamlessly request to borrow them from nearby neighbors. Similarly, users can list their own tools for lending, fostering a culture of sharing and collaboration within the community.  Bid farewell to the inconvenience of purchasing expensive tools for one-off projects. Embrace HandyHub and become part of a more sustainable and resourceful community.
